# Turntables - The Office Trivia Game
Turntables is a trivia game built in a 24h hackathon at BrainStations software development bootcamp by [Carlos Ocampo](https://github.com/estebanchos/estebanchos "Carlos Ocampo") and [Jimmy Zhen](https://github.com/JimmyZ98 "Jimmy Zhen"). 
The trivia is based on the tv show The Office and leveraging [The Office API](https://www.officeapi.dev "The Office API"). 

Front-end repo: [The-Office-Game](https://github.com/JimmyZ98/The-Office-Game "The-Office-Game")

## About The Project 
* **The Challenge:** Our educators challenged us to build a full stack app in 24h. The app had to either use a third-party API, or we had to make our own API.
* **The Idea:** We decided to build a Trivia Game because our bootcamp cohort liked The Office tv show and had fun during our bootcamp quizzes on Kahoot. 
* **The Application:** 
  * Users need to match the quote to the correct character.
  * More points are awarded for faster answers.
  * Users can enter the leaderboard and will see an alert letting them know their position on the leaderboard.
* *Note: Post hackathon, we cleaned up some of the remaining bugs and improved the styling of the web app just a bit, because we wanted to keep our code as close as what we presented in the hackathon.*

## Lessons Learned
* During the planning phase of the hackathon, we discussed which features we wanted to include in our trivia game. However, we had not budgeted how long it would take to build out each feature. As a result, we were not able to build out everything that we had originally planned and didn't spend as much time on the styling component as we had hoped to. Going forward, we have learned to budget time for each task and how to prioritize tasks so that we could create a minimal viable project that we could improve upon.
* This project was one of our first opportunities to work in a collaborative environment after learning about Gitflow. As such we ran into merge conflicts throughout the project and even encountered some bugs that didn't exist when working on our individual local repositories. This ended up slowing us down as we had to spend time resolving the issues before proceeding. Going forward, we have learned the importance of keeping code and branches well organized, as well as communicating clearly with team members in order to have a smooth collaborative working environment.
