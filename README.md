# Turntables - The Office Trivia Game
Turntables is a trivia game built in a 24h hackathon at BrainStations software development bootcamp by [Carlos Ocampo](https://github.com/estebanchos/estebanchos "Carlos Ocampo") and [Jimmy Zhen](https://github.com/JimmyZ98 "Jimmy Zhen"). 
The trivia is based on the tv show The Office and leveraging [The Office API](https://www.officeapi.dev "The Office API").

## About The Project 
* **The Challenge:** Our educators challenged us to build a full stack app in 24h. The app had to either use a third-party API, or we had to make our own API.
* **The Idea:** We decided to build a Trivia Game because our bootcamp cohort liked The Office tv show and had fun during our bootcamp quizzes on Kahoot. 
* **The Application:** 
  * Users need to match the quote to the correct character.
  * More points are awarded for faster answers.
  * Users can enter the leaderboard and will see an alert letting them know their position on the leaderboard.
* *Note: Post hackathon, we cleaned up some of the remaining bugs and improved the styling of the web app a bit to keep our code as close as what we presented in the hackathon.*
